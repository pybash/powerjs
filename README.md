# powerjs
Translator that embeds new functions into Javascript.<br>
<b>Look in examples</b>

# how to translate
Compile powerjs_transpiler.cpp if needed, there is a release section. <br>
Do `powerjs_transpiler.exe -t [fileName, has to end with .powerjs]` <br>
# todo
Libaries should be able to import other files too <br>
Prevent libaries from being imported two times (since it is compiling to all one script)
